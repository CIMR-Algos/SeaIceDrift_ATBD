This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) is a reference for the
algorithms implemented in the OSISAF Low-Resolution Sea Ice Drift
Climate Data Record (OSI/̄455) v1.

All processing steps are described: satellite image pre-processing,
single/̄sensor motion tracking with the Continuous Maximum
Cross-Correlation (CMCC), wind-driven drift estimates in the summer
season, multi/̄source merging, and uncertainties.
